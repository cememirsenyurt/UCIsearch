UCI Search Engine (Information Retrieval)

This project consist of two main flavors:

(1) Information Analyst:
This flavor is a mixture of the Text
Processing project and stitching things together. We will be using a small subset of
the crawled pages. 

(2) Algorithms and Data Structures Developer:
In this flavor, not only there is programming to be done, but the code needs to be able to perform well on the
entire collection of crawled pages, under harsh operating conditions.

General Specifications
We developed two separate programs: an indexer and a search component.

Indexer:
Create an inverted index for the given corpus with data structures designed by us.

Tokens: all alphanumeric sequences in the dataset.

Stop words: do not use stopping, i.e. use all words, even the frequently occurring
ones.

Stemming: use stemming for better textual matches. Suggestion: Porter stemming.

Important words: Words in bold, in headings (h1, h2, h3), and in titles should be
treated as more important than the other words.

Search:
Thr program should prompt the user for a query. This doesnâ€™t need to be a Web
interface, it can be a console prompt. At the time of the query, your program will
stem the query terms, look up your index, perform some calculations (see ranking
below) and give out the ranked list of pages that are relevant for the query, with the
most relevant on top. Pages should be identified by their URLs.

Ranking: at the very least, your ranking formula should include tf-idf scoring, and
take the important words into consideration, but you should feel free to add
additional components to this formula if you think they improve the retrieval.
